# Reviewing Submissions

- Submissions to ACMC are generally reviewed by (at least) two members of the computer music / music tech community.
- Reviewing is normally single-blind (reviewer is anonymous to the submitter, but the reviewer can see the submitter's identity).
- Reviews are normally of the **abstract** (not full papers) for papers and artist talks.

In the past, ACMC has used EasyChair to run reviewing and we found (2020) that the free tier was sufficient for organising the conference. EasyChair can be tricky to understand, but it's only bad compared to all the other conference management systems out their :-)

In 2021 Vince Giles created his own reviewing system with Microsoft Forms and Excel which seemed to work ok.
