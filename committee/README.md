# Committee

This part of the cookbook contains some todo lists for each member of the conference committee.

Each year, ACMC will have an organising committee with something like:

1. General Chair(s)
2. Paper/Artist Talk Chair(s)
3. Music Chair(s)
4. Workshop Chair(s)
5. Inclusion Chair(s)
6. Social Media Coordinator(s)

We suggest including at least one member of the general [ACMA Committee](https://computermusic.org.au/committee/) or the committee of a previous ACMC to help with continuity and organisational knowledge.
