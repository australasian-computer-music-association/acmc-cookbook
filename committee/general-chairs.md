# General Chairs

This is a list of tasks for the **general chair(s)** of each ACMC.

1. organise conference website
2. organise call for participation
3. organise review and submission process (with other chairs)
4. broadcast conference announcement & CfP through all ACMA social and communication channels (6-8 months before conference)

etc.

## Code of Conduct

The general chair is ultimately responsible for communication and enforcement of [ACMA's Code of Conduct](https://computermusic.org.au/conferences/code-of-conduct/) during ACMC. The buck stops with them in terms of making the conference a safe and inclusive place for all participants.
