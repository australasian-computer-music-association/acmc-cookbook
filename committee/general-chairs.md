# General Chairs

This is a list of tasks for the **general chair(s)** of each ACMC.

1. organise conference website
2. organise call for participation
3. organise review and submission process (with other chairs)
4. broadcast conference announcement & CfP through all ACMA social and communication channels (6-8 months before conference)
5. arranginng registration fees and managing conference finnances
6. collecting ACMA membership fees as a percentage of registrations and returning this component of the registration to ACMA

etc.

## Code of Conduct

The general chair is ultimately responsible for communication and enforcement of [ACMA's Code of Conduct](https://computermusic.org.au/conferences/code-of-conduct/) during ACMC. The buck stops with them in terms of making the conference a safe and inclusive place for all participants.

## Registration and Fees

ACMA does not typically run the registrations for conferences, this is usually the responsibility of the local organisers.

Traditionally, registration at ACMC includes a 1-year membership to the ACMA. The association collects some proportion of the conference registration fees. This is the main way that the ACMA raises money, used to pay for hosting expenses and potentially scholarships, etc so it's an important consideration.

The general chair and president of ACMA should agree well before the conference about the proportion of registration fees which would be paid to ACMA or if a lump sum covering certain costs would be preferable.

## Funding from ACMA

ACMA does not provide funding to conference organisers for operational expenses (e.g., venue hire, technician costs, catering). This mainly because ACMA is an unfunded community organisation not likely to have that kind of money. ACMA has (and could in future) contribute to scholarships for low/no-income attendees or performers but this is contingent on takings from previous year's conference.

## How to pay for ACMC

We suggest keeping ACMC as a low-expense / low-registrationn fee event to include a maximum number of potential contributors and participants.

In general running ACMC involves some operational expenses:

- venue hire
- technician hire
- catering
- fees/honorariums for keynote speakers
- web/hosting fees

This is usually paid for with a combination of in-kind support from the hosting institution, registration/ticket sales, and contributions from sponsors.

In our experience, it is posible to run a very low-cost ACMC with a very high pay-off in terms of community engagement! DIY is good!
