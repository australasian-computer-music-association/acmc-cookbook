# Hybrid Conference Services

Here are a list of the services used for the conference which can be shared with new organisers:

## Discord

Discord is a community chat system which doesn't require a user account to get started. ACMC started using Discord in 2020, it's good for back-channel chats with participants and between organisers during the conferece.

## Youtube

ACMA has a YouTube Channnel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK95K68yVuok-qWNS4Z6Jw

In 2020 the whole conference content was put on the channel (all performances, papers, and keynotes). In 2021, the keynotes and performances were streamed to the channel.

The committe has experience using OBS to stream to YouTube as well as other channels, so this is a possibility for future conferences.
