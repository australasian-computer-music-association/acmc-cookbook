# Social Media Channels

ACMA has the following social media channels that can be made available to the organisers for promotion and communication before, during and after the conference

## ACMA-l Mailing List

An oldie, but a goodie. As a scholarly organisation ACMA still maintains an email mailing list: [ACMA-l](https://computermusic.org.au/acma-list/)

Don't forget to use the list for communications of the CfP, conference registration, etc (and multiple reminders of these). The email address is: <acma-l@lists.computermusic.org.au>
